<h1>Boom Triangulation</h1>
<p>"Ok who's getting raided?" One of the first questions uttered when that magical sound is heard. However we've come to understand that the least equipped to answer that question is usually the very same bags of signal absorbing water asking it in the first place. So today we propose an alternative... though geometry!</p>
<p>We've all heard of triangulation from movies. At some point the protagonists will need to find something or someone, so our heroes set up three sensors, wait for a progress bar and viola, X marks plot progression. Well that's actually trilateration... Triangulation instead refers to the two right angle triangles that can describe any three points on a plane. Which enables the sensors to do a bit of trigonometry and infer the position of the source given foreknowledge about their own displacement from each other</p>
<p>So how does this help you figure out where the raid is? Well, knowledge of the mechanics will help the team understand how to effectively deploy the tool instead of forming a cargo cult. That said, just let it bubble in the back of your head for now. Here's how to use the feature:</p>
<ol>
    <li>When boom is heard, point your noggin in the direction from which it came and read its cardinal angle from the top of your in game HUD</li>
    <li>Type in team chat "boom ANGLE" (eg: "boom 129")</li>
    <li>The program will check the team's exact coordinates at the time the messages are received, run its algorithm, and to produce an estimation of where it came from</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the further apart the reports are from each other the more accurate the estimate, ideally surrounding the source. We understand this is not how a team usually situate themselves. Which is why the workbench enables team leaders to share reports as intelligence events with their friends. This is mainly to prevent association leaks</p>
<p>So what about the dyslexic person who can't read numbers? Or those seemingly deaf in one ear? Well the algorithm automatically groups together data that mostly agrees with each other as a way to support multiple concurrent workflows. So an obviously wrong sample will be harmlessly ignored. Thus we encourage everyone on the team to report, more data could only help</p>
