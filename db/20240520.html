<h1>A Grid's dimension is 146</h1>
<p>Hume's guillotine teaches us there are two kinds of beliefs, those from without based on observation and those from within based on preference. It also teaches us that the tools of logical inference, though helpful they may be in either domain, can never soundly cross from one into the other without tidbits native to the destination. A simple demonstration of this principle is that given the choice some people prefers the HMLMG over the AK. However, whether such a choice can be made at all has nothing to do with the preferences of said person</p>
<p>Now, the prevailing belief is that a grid is a 150 units square. However this isn't true. The closer estimation is in fact 146 and I come bearing proof. On my test server I aligned myself with a teleport command</p>

<p>I then teleported horizontally until I displaced myself exactly to the adjacent square... lo and behold 146 units of displacement.. not 150</p>

<p>Now you may be wondering "why do I care?". I could go on harping about the importance of precision, but I will not. Instead I want you to think about how you've reacted to this information, especially those of you who firmly believed 150 was the correct answer</p>
<p>In professional development, there is a concept known as the "Growth Mindset". A person embodying such a trait would receive this information, perhaps verify it, and then add to their beliefs accordingly. They would not only find reasons to ignore the information, even if it is wrong or not what they might need in the moment. Because such a person understands that one's beliefs and the substance of their character are separated just as much as their objective and subjective beliefs. Thus the growth minded person is reassured in the understanding that the only thing they have to lose in change are the chains of stagnancy</p>
